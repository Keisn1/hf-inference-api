* Exploring HF-inference-api

The repo aims at getting familiar with the inference API as well as the
different tasks and modalities provided

- [X] Text classification
- [X] Text generation
- [X] Summarization
- [X] Image classification
- [ ] Image segmentation
- [ ] Object detection
- [ ] Audio classification
- [ ] Automatic speech recognition
- [ ] Visual question answering
- [ ] Document question answering
- [ ] Image captioning

It also aims at getting used to Best Software Development practices / Clean Code
/ 12 factor methodology and Security practices.

** General
*** API Token and Setup
- Setup API Token
  - trying to follow 12 factor app and best security practices
  - should be environment variables
  - I guess there is a debate if .env files oblige the 12Factor methodology
  - 2 ways
    - python-decouple
    - python-dotenv
  - python-dotenv seems more modern therefore using this

- requirements
  - pip freeze > requirements.txt to have exact dependencies
*** API Options
[[https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/detailed_parameters][detailed parameters]]
*** CPU acceleration
- check x-compute-type header of request shall be 'cpu+optimized'
*** Loading and Latency
- if requested model not loaded, 503
- inference endpoint if necessary

** Text classification
